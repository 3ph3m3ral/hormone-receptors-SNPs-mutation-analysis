### ENCODE PROJECT
https://www.encodeproject.org/


The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) is a public research project which aims to identify functional elements in the human genome. 

Encode was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in September 200. Intended as a follow-up to the Human Genome Project, the ENCODE project aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome. 

ENCODE is currently implemented in four phases: the pilot phase and the technology development phase, which were initiated simultaneously;[10] and the production phase. The fourth phase is a continuation of the third, and includes functional characterization and further integrative analysis for the encyclopedia.
