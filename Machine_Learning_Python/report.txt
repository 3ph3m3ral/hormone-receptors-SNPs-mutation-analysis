    Report from the application of ML_2 and ML_3 models:
    
    - the number of hidden layers, and hidden layer neurons has no significant change on the accuracy of the model
    - the accuracy found was ~62% of the model for the binary prediction of cancer_type features
    - the problem into the model is that the majority of false positive is the case of false 0 labeled predictions (false assumption).
    - changing the features used for the prediction has no increase on the accuracy, but could instead decrease it. 
    
    
    in conclusion:
    
        the model has high accuracy generated, 
        but very variable on the initial seed random number ,
        tha accuracy range from 37% to 82% ( having tried it five times ).
